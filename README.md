## About

A collective 'behind the scenes' portfolio showcase to accompany other visual and live demo references.
Primarily intended as one-stop source to be reviewed by other developers to assess the code style and quality.

It can also be a source of inspiration for new projects.

## How to use

Review the code quality from a developer's perspective.

This is about the tech stack, code quality, and architectural solutions.

Code has been grouped into the primary stack. For all projects, this also includes HTML 5 and CSS 3/X.

Projects have been created over a range of years and under different circumstances (e.g., budget, deadline, tooling ecosystem, standards).

## Notes

Any code shown here has been based on specific requirements and problems to be solved at that time.

The presented application shells are stripped-down and non-functional sources. The code can't be installed or run. An IDE likely shows errors due to missing resources.

_Due to the nature of this being a static code demo, functionality was not a concern. While preparing these files, it's likely that some syntax errors might have appeared. The code has been automatically 'prettified', but not checked afterward._
